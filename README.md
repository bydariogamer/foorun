# description
This is one of those silly games in which you just run and run jumping to avoid smashing your sweet face against a cactus, or any other random obstacle.
# dependecies
It works with python3 and the pygame module. random might be imported to (but it is provided with python3, not needed installation).
# license
The game itself is under GNU General Public License 3.0 (or the newest if you make a derivative and you want to update it).
The images are in the public domain: I think anyone can draw some lines and circles to make all the graphics.
